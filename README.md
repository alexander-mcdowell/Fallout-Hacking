My attempt at coding the "hacking" mini-game in the Fallout series of games using Python. The game is very similar to Mastermind and involves guessing a codeword from a list of options given how many characters they share in common at the same location in the word (e.g: TEXT and HITS have 0/4 characters in common, while FITS and HITS have 3/4 characters in common).

To play the game, simply run ```python falloutHacking.py``` in your terminal of choice.
